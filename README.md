# Hell Freezes Over

This mod prevents SeedFix from overwriting the overworld seed with one from the Nether in case the overworld seed somehow becomes 0.
This is useful if you have a mod that modifies the seed of the Nether (such as Incendium).
However, it will overwrite the seeds of any dimension that uses the Minecraft noise generator.
